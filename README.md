This project is a real-time chat application built using React.js for the frontend, Express.js for the backend, and Socket.IO for enabling real-time, bi-directional communication between clients and the server. The main objective of this application is to provide a seamless and responsive messaging experience similar to popular chat platforms.

The frontend, developed using React.js, runs on http://localhost:3000. It offers a clean and responsive user interface where users can enter chat rooms, send messages, view incoming messages in real-time, and see when other users are typing or online. Reactâ€™s component-based architecture and use of hooks enable efficient UI rendering and state management.

The backend, built with Express.js, runs on http://localhost:5000. It acts as the central server that handles client connections, chat room logic, and message broadcasting. It uses Socket.IO to manage WebSocket connections, allowing real-time communication between multiple clients simultaneously.

Socket.IO enables low-latency, event-driven communication. It ensures messages are instantly sent and received without needing page reloads. It also supports additional real-time features like user join/leave notifications and typing indicators.
